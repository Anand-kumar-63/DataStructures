I always waited for her , but she didn't... she always trying to told me that people change so you should too but I didn't because i promised her that i will never change I was keeping even that small promise , I never thought she is trying to say about herself....that she changed she got some else and I was there all the time waiting for her since 5 years..

I was just a temporary option for you never a priority....I always cried i always needed you i was always there for you I did everything i can possibly do for you... But not you it was never you who ever told me to hey! stay i need you as well , it was never you who want me in her life it was never you who needed me it was just me just me...

Now you just leave I would rather die than spending even a sec with you from now you are dead for me.

I Never even thought to have someone else in my life and give that person the space i have given to you but never even thought about this... but! you never thought , you never cared ....you got detached from me and then you got someone else now you are here at very peak of my life saying move on I have someone else.....I was always there for her i never changed 

she did the same that every single one did to me in this entire life... enter my life get attached spend a fucking lot of time then leave and when the other person try to say anything just blame him.

I was never prepared to say i love you but now i am saying this from the very bottom of my heart I hate you! either you should have told me All this at the very begining or you would never told me about this..
