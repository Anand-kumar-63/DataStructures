8 ancestors and desendents

# Types of the Binary tree

## Complete binary tree 
- All levels should be full except the last one
- and nodes are filled from left to right 

## Full Binary Tree / Strict binary tree
- **every node has either exactly two children or zero children**—there are **no nodes with only one child**.
A binary tree is **strict** if for every node `N`:
- `N` has **0 children** (leaf node), or
- `N` has **2 children** (internal node
There is **no case** where a node has only a left child or only a right child.

2. Total number of nodes 
    If there is perfect binary tree , height = h
    Total number of  nodes = 2pow(h+1)-1
